# Calo-App

**Motivation and Purpose** 

Since quarantine began in the early part of 2020 due to Coronavirus, the last thing many individuals have pointed their attention to is their physical health.<br />
During the COVID-19 outbreak, we realized we weren’t as active as we should’ve,  so we created this app to help us track our daily exercise and weight so that we can see whether we are staying active or not.<br />
Web application that helps people to track their weight and daily activities. Users will be able to create their specific goals and track their progress. Calo app will also provide feedback to the users based off their BMI.<br />
